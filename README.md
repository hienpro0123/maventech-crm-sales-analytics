# MavenTech Project
MavenTech is a B2B technology company that specializes in selling computer hardware solutions to large enterprise clients. To manage and track its sales opportunities, MavenTech recently implemented a new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. While the CRM effectively captures detailed opportunity-level data, the company currently lacks visibility into sales performance outside of the platform.

MavenTech holds a substantial volume of data related to sales opportunities, products, customer accounts, and deal outcomes. However, this data has not been fully leveraged to generate actionable insights for sales leadership. This project aims to analyze and transform the CRM data into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making for **sales managers**.

By developing an interactive Power BI dashboard, this project enables sales managers to monitor quarterly performance, evaluate individual and team-level results, and identify areas for improvement. The dashboard is designed to provide a clear view of key performance indicators (KPIs) while allowing users to explore trends across time, products, and sales teams.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: Evaluation of overall and quarterly sales performance, focusing on total revenue, number of deals, conversion rates, and average deal value.

- **Team & Individual Performance**: Analysis of sales results at both team and individual salesperson levels to identify high performers and areas requiring additional support.

- **Pipeline & Conversion Insights**: Assessment of won versus lost opportunities to better understand conversion effectiveness and sales efficiency.

- **Comparative Performance**: Comparison of team performance against company-wide averages to provide context and benchmarking insights.

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
